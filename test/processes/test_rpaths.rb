  # Ensure that any binaries have RPATH settings stripped before they're
  # installed. This ensures that the load path is always determined by
  # LD_LIBRARY_PATH, rather than whatever RPATH was set at compile time.
  #
  # This makes the installation path more relocatable, but also helps prevent
  # conflicts with the files installed in "build/work/stage" during
  # development/testing and the files in "/opt/api-umbrella." This primarily
  # impacts development and testing (since normal installations won't have
  # conflicting versions of things), but this helps ensure the staged binaries
  # always get picked up before system-wide binaries when running tests
  # (assuming LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly). This helps prevent frustrating
  # debugging in development environments where both might be present. Since
  # this also makes the paths more configurable and relocatable, this also
  # seems like a decent approach for production purposes.
