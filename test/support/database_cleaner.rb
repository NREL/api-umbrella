# Clean the database using deletion.

# We can't use transactions, since we rely on the data we insert in the tests
# being available to the remote test server, which won't share the transaction.
#
# We use deletion instead of truncation, since it seems to perform better for
# our specific use-cases. We also need to be careful to preserve sequence IDs
# due to our polling logic (eg, polling for published_configs changes).
#
# We previously used the database_cleaner gem, but we've hit some bugs
# (https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner-active_record/issues/62),
# and can further optimize using a custom approach
# (https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner-active_record/issues/26).
