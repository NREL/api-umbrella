    # For our custom radio/checkboxes, we need to click on the label, rather
    # than the input (since the input is technically hidden and only virtually
    # shown). The "automatic_label_click" option makes this work in most cases,
    # so we can use the default "check" and "uncheck" helpers", however for our
    # "User agrees to the terms and conditions" checkbox, this doesn't work,
    # since that label also has a link tag embedded inside, so clicking on the
    # center of the label ends up triggering the popup, rather than the
    # checkbox checking/unchecking.
    #
    # So these batch of label helpers are for cases where we know we need to
    # click directly on the label, and they also accept ":click" options that
    # are passed along to the label click for controlling it's position.
    #
    # Should be identical to the existing implementation, except that it
    # accepts the click options, and we don't bother trying to click on the
    # checkbox/radio first:
