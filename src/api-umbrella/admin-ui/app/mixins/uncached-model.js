  // Call before fetching a model to clear any client-side cache data.
  //
  // This works around a couple different issues with ember-data, which is why
  // we're explicitly documenting this approach with a mixin. It's a bit
  // heavy-handed by clearing the entire client-side cache, but since we
  // generally want to re-fetch data from the server (in case other users are
  // making edits at the same time), it's the simplest current approach.
  //
  // - Prevents duplicate embedded records from showing up after edits. Without
  //   this, if you add a new embedded record, save, and then visit the parent
  //   record again, the new embedded record will be duplicated twice. This is
  //   because we don't add client-side IDs for these embedded records so the
  //   ID-less embedded record and the one with the ID after saving will both
  //   be present. See https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/1829
  // - Clears local edits if you make changes to a record, then navigate away
  //   (while explicitly confirming that you wanted to navigate away), and then
  //   come back to edit the same record. Other approaches to clear these
  //   changes don't seem to work as intended or as we want:
  //     - reload or shouldReloadRecord continues to persist the local edits
  //       despite fetching the record from the remote ajax call again.
  //     - rollbackAttributes doesn't work for embedded relationship data.
  //
  // Note that this should be combined with { reload: true } options on the
  // subsequent finds. unloadAll only schedules the unloading for the next
  // Ember run cycle, and this combination seems necessary to fully refresh
  // things:
  //
  // https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/4564
